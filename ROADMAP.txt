Coming up soon: 
	* New internal data format
	* Require max output shapes instead of just max output total byte sizes

Experiment with block floating point instead, then we would just need to carry
around exponent instead of min/max, and computations get much easier.

Cleanup Reshape/Flatten+Min+Max+Quantize into new Quantize node

Implement our own graph quantization routine between init and prepare:
	* For every supported node, change to Quantize->QuantizedOp->Dequantize
	* Clean up Dequantize->Quantize
