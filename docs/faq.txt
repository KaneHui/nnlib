Q: I get performance info for my nodes.  What happened to all the convolution,
   and why is Relu taking so long?

A: The framework optimizes the common idiom
   QuantizedConv2D->Requantize->BiasAdd->Requantize->Relu into a single node.
   The ID of this new node is the ID of the Relu node, since other nodes will be
   using it as their source.  Since the interface only knows Node IDs, this is
   reported in the output information as the Relu node.
