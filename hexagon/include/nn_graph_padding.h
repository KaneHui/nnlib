 * ((size + stride - 1) + filt_size - size - stride) - ((size + stride - 1) % stride)
 * size and stride cancel
 * filt_size - 1 - ((size + stride - 1) % stride)
 * Or the filter size - 1 unless we have some extra pixels from striding.  That makes sense, I guess.
 * padding_before is floor(half(padding)) and padding_after is the remainder.
